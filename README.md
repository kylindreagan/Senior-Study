# Algorithm Design and Implementation Repository

**Author:** Kylind Reagan

---

## Overview
This repository contains my implementations, experiments, and notes related to **advanced algorithm design and analysis**. The purpose is not only to provide working code for classical and modern algorithms, but also to document the reasoning, trade-offs, and performance considerations behind each approach.  

Algorithms here span both theoretical foundations and practical applications in **data science, optimization, and large-scale computation**. My goal is to turn this into a long-term reference and resource as I deepen my understanding of the field.

## Motivation
Algorithms are the foundation of efficient problem solving across computer science and applied disciplines.  
This repository reflects my effort to:

- Strengthen my theoretical foundation by studying advanced algorithmic ideas.  
- Connect theory with practice by **implementing and testing algorithms**.  
- Provide **reusable, well-documented code** for future projects in optimization, machine learning, and systems design.  
- Document insights, learning outcomes, and open questions along the way.

## Goals
- Implement advanced techniques: flow networks, approximation algorithms, streaming methods.  
- Compare paradigms: **deterministic vs. randomized**, **exact vs. approximate**.  
- Benchmark performance and scalability on synthetic + real-world data.  
- Explore emerging directions: spectral graph theory, convex optimization, quantum computing.  
- Build a **structured, well-documented archive** of algorithms and notes.
